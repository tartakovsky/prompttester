# Fix landing port for Railway deployment

**Date:** 2026-02-18 15:53
**Task:** Fix 502 — landing app listens on hardcoded 3011 but Railway expects $PORT

## Goal
Landing app starts on Railway's expected port so prompttester.io serves correctly.

## Approach
Change `start` script to use `$PORT` with fallback to 3011: `next start -p ${PORT:-3011}`

## Files to Modify
- `apps/landing/package.json` — Fix start script
