# Change Inputs accent from amber to teal, unify result label shades

**Date:** 2026-02-17 20:38
**Scope:** `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`

## Summary
Replaced amber (yellow-orange) Inputs accent with teal — amber evoked warning/problem feelings. Unified result grid label colors to use the same shade as section titles.

## Decisions Made

### Teal for Inputs
- **Chose:** teal — calm, neutral green-blue
- **Why:** User feedback that amber/yellow/red evoke problem/warning feelings. Teal is neutral and distinct from blue (Prompts) and violet (Models).

### Remove separate label shade
- **Chose:** Use `.title` shade for both section headers and result grid labels
- **Why:** User wanted same shade in both places for visual consistency. Removed the separate `.label` field from accentStyles.
