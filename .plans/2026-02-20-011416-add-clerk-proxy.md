# Add missing Clerk proxy.ts for Next.js 16

**Date:** 2026-02-20 01:14
**Task:** Fix server-side crash — Clerk auth() can't find clerkMiddleware()

## Goal
Create `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` so Clerk's `auth()` works in API routes and server components.

## Approach
Copy the pattern from legacy `apps/web/src/proxy.ts`. Next.js 16 uses `proxy.ts` (renamed from `middleware.ts`). Clerk's `clerkMiddleware()` is exported as default.
