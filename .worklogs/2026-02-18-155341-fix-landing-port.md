# Fix landing port for Railway

**Date:** 2026-02-18 15:53
**Scope:** `apps/landing/package.json`

## Summary
Changed the start script from hardcoded port 3011 to `${PORT:-3011}` so Railway can inject its PORT variable. This fixes the 502 error on prompttester.io.

## Context & Problem
Railway build succeeded but the landing app returned 502. The app was listening on hardcoded port 3011 while Railway expects the app to listen on its injected `$PORT` variable.

## Key Files for Context
- `apps/landing/package.json` — start script with port config
