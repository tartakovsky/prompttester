# Results UX fixes + delete confirmation

**Date:** 2026-02-17 19:22
**Task:** Three fixes: no add/remove in results sidebar, hide results during eval, confirm test delete

## Approach

### 1. Results sidebar: read-only
The ItemList in the results section currently passes onAdd/onRemove/onRename — allowing users to add prompts or models from the results view. Remove add/remove capability from results sidebar by making ItemList support a `readOnly` prop that hides the + button and × buttons.

### 2. Hide results table during evaluation
Currently results show incrementally as they arrive. Instead:
- When `evaluating` is true, hide the results table and show a spinner/loading state
- Only show results after all evaluations complete
- Clear results at the start of eval, populate them all at once at the end

Actually simpler: just don't render the results section when `evaluating` is true. Show a loading indicator instead.

### 3. Confirm test deletion
Add a window.confirm() dialog before deleting a test. Simple and effective.

## Files to Modify
- `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — all three changes
