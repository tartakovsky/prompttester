# Add missing Clerk proxy.ts

**Date:** 2026-02-20 01:14
**Scope:** apps/web/src/proxy.ts

## Summary
Added missing `proxy.ts` file that was not copied during the template migration. Without it, Clerk's `auth()` crashes at runtime because `clerkMiddleware()` was never registered.

## Context & Problem
After deploying the migrated app, every page load crashed with: "Clerk: auth() was called but Clerk can't detect usage of clerkMiddleware()". The legacy app had `src/proxy.ts` but it wasn't recreated during the migration.

## Decisions Made
- **Chose:** Default export of `clerkMiddleware()` with no route protection (matches legacy behavior)
- **Why:** Route protection is client-side via `<SignedIn>`/`<SignedOut>` — the proxy just needs to make `auth()` available

## Key Files for Context
- `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` — Clerk middleware for Next.js 16
